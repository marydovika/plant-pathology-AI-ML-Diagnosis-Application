# plant-pathology-AI-ML-Diagnosis-Application
Plant Disease Daignosis and Pest Identification AI python based System,
A REAL TIME DISEASE AND PEST IDENTIFICATION SOLUTION (PLANT PATHOLOGY PROJECT)
///////////
the app is not having the python backend files and the buttons are disabled,
the graphical interface is currently launched in electron, install nodejs, and electron, on your pc,
then run electron from the terminal/ cmd. and navigate to the project folder, then launch main.js file.or just run gui.html in chrome with internet connection.
i hope to use GTK+ for the GUI in the final application after i get the time to embark on the python backend files,
for weather, pest, and disease detection. am willing to accept any collaboration for the AI-ML python dev.

i want to first develop GTK+ gui of the app., as the next step from here.
